    <p>You'll pan fry thinly sliced Brussels sprouts with garlic and pancetta in olive oil, toss with mozzarella cheese and a little fennel seed, and bake all the good stuff on pizza crust. "Truly a wonderful gourmet pizza," says Mixit. "Every ingredient worked beautifully together and the fennel seeds give a special touch. I added a tiny bit of red chili flakes before eating which was a nice addition. Great way to get your kids to eat their Brussels sprouts."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>9 slices pancetta</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 Brussels sprouts, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon fennel seed</li>
        <li>1 12-inch pizza crust</li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pancetta until fat has been released, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining 5 teaspoons olive oil into the same skillet; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 20 seconds.
